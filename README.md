# Blogger

You are becoming a software engineer, its time to start acting the part. Blogging is a tremendous and simple way to prepare for your journey. As a student of Telegraph Academy, it is imperative that you have a full grasp of the many concepts that will be covered. Blogging aids in solidifying your understanding by forcing you to speak like an engineer, while also breaking things down into detail. By blogging about your experiences in programming, employers will be exposed first hand to a. how you can explain things and b. how well you understand a specific concept.  So gear up for your journey, and let the world know how youâ€™ve progressed!

## What do I blog about?

As a part of the precourse curriculum, you are required to blog about the topics that are covered leading up to Day 1. As a refresher, these topics should include, but may not be limited to:

- [] Scope
- [] Using Libraries (i.e Underscorejs)
- [] jQuery
- [] Recursion

If you're feeling really ambitious, some other topics that are experienced coming in include:

- [] Choosing a bootcamp to attend (let the world know why you chose TGA!)
- [] Preparing for the entrance interview
- [] Why you want to be an engineer
- [] Sublime Text or your IDE of choice
- [] Using Terminal and Git
- [] Other programming languages vs JS

As you complete the precourse curriculum, it is a good idea to write your thoughts down as you go. This will be a great way to keep track of what you've learn, struggled with, and how you handled the struggle. This will also allow the blog to write itself, and keep you from rushing last minute. _Writer's block is real!_

## Getting Started

The first step in creating a blog is deciding where to host your blog. There are many blog sites that exist, some better than others. If you are just getting started, we recommend using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and/or [Medium](medium.com). Other popular blog sites include [Wordpress](Wordpress.com), [blogger](blogger.com), [Ghost](ghost.org). **Keep in mind that this is a professional blog that you will be using to show employers, so sites like _Tumblr_ may not fit the bill.** 

##### GitHub Pages w/Jekyll

Github allows for a user to host a page of their own on its servers. You will be creating this page from scratch or using a templating service, such as [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). Creating your own blog from scrach will allow for practice with HTML and CSS. Using Github Pages also allows for you to get extra practice with Git and the CLI, as changes to your page will be committed and pushed to your blog's repo. _Woo Hoo! More green squares for your profile!_
